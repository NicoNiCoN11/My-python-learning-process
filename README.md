# My-python-learning-process
This repository is used for me to save my code and record my learning process in different periods.

I will learn Python through following these steps

Step1: Use jupyter notebook to do some basic data processing and data mining(matpylotlib, numpy, pandas, sklearn)

Step2: Use Pycharm to design some simple scripts that can analysis data or do process data automatically(os, sys, shutill, subprocess)

Step3: Read some code designed by other researchers and develop my own code(Github)

Step4: Learn something about DeepLearning.
